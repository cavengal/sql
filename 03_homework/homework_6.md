**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Reflecting on my time Colombia's Ministry of Finance as and analyst for the National Budget Office, I believe I could have taken extra steps to enhance ethics and equity considerations into my work. Being my first job, my focus was mostly on accuracy, efficiency, and the Macroeconomic impact of budget allocations back then. In hindsight, I see the importance of broadening this perspective to ensure that the data that supported budgetary decisions not only helped us asses  impact on  economic growth but also allowed to  promote social equity and upheld ethical standards. Two achievable steps that would have improved theses:  

1. Prioritize inclusive data collection methods to represent all segments of the populationâ€”by income, race, gender, and location for each of the national agencies under my supervision. Instead of relying solely on aggregate data, I should have delved into disaggregated data to uncover disparities that might be hidden in overall statistics.

2. Clearly communicating the methodologies, assumptions and analyzing the rationalle of decision algorithms underlying budgetary analyses, as well as being open about data limitations, would have fostered trust.

These two steps were achievable back then and although they would have required a commitment to inclusive data collection and analytical processes,  incorporating them in my work would have not only supported economic efficiency but also promoted social justice and ethical governance.
